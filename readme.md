# About
The [Last.fm Youtube Radio](https://lastfm.rimkus.it) searches and plays the listened tracks of a given [Last.fm User](https://www.last.fm/user/ravermeister)  on [YouTube](https://youtube.com). It is possible to search for alternative Youtube Videos or enter a video url directly. The Tracks which have a fixed Video Id will have a **'*'** prefixed. You can create your own playlist via menu 'add to playlist'. Additionally there is a Chart list which will be updated each time a song is heared. The Chart Counter works as follows:

  * get the length of the Song divided by 2. 
  if it is greater than 2 minutes use 2 minutes as timeout, 
  otherwise use calculated length. 
  * when the Timeout is reached, increase playcount for Song.

The Timer is designed to stop when player is paused, and will continue when the player continues to play.

## Listen to other Last.fm User's Song Timeline
You can sarch any [Last.fm User](https://www.last.fm/user/ravermeister) and listen to the Song Timeline.

## Admin interface
There is an admin php cli Interface for Importing the replacement.csv Files and generating the sitemap.xml file.  
Call `php admin.php` inside the lastfmtube Folder for more info.

## replacements.csv
You can use [Regular Expressions](https://www.php.net/manual/de/function.preg-match.php) for Replacing Artist and Title information if the Song information is messy, sothat the search string that is send to youtube can be corrected in an efficient way. The csv is stored in the database after importing through the admin cli Interface. New- and Changed Files can be (re-)Imported with the admin interface at any time. See the `init.replacement.example.csv` for more details.

# Directory Structure:
  - __conf__ Configuration Files and [SQLite Database](https://sqlite.org)
  - __conf/settings.json__ copy from `settings.example.json`, here you have to adjust the Youtube/Last.fm settings for the player.
  - __conf/init.replacements_example.csv__ This is  an example file for the Track correction CSV files which you can import via the Admin-cli interface. Regular Expression Groups can be used to define replacements for a specific part of a track to e.g. remove *[unnknown]* from the Song Titles, extract the artist name from the title etc.
  - __conf/lasttube.db__ this is the sqlite Database (will be created automatically)
  - __themes__ place new themes into this directory. (theming is untested)
simply copy an existing theme directory and rename it to your new theme name (and adjust `settings.json` as needed)
